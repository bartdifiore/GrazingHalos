#  Grazing halos on coral reefs: predation risk, herbivore density, and habitat size influence grazing patterns visible from space.

This repository houses code and data related to a manuscript (DiFiore et al. 2019) that explores how predation risk, herbivore density, and patch reef size influence the formation of grazing halos. Grazing halos are barren areas of sand surrounding coral patch reefs that are formed by herbivores foraging close to the safety of the reef structure (see image below). Using satellite remote sensing and observation field experiments we 1) quantified variation in grazing halo width across broad landscapes in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (Florida, USA) and the South Water Caye Marine Reserve (Belize), 2) explored the factors that affect how far herbivorous fish graze from refuges, and 3) linked local scale processes with landscape variation in grazing halos visible in satellite imagery.
