# GrazingHalos

This repository contains code files associated with the analysis of drivers of variation in grazing halos. The code represents the analysis conducted for the recently submitted manuscript. Cleaned data files will be provided upon request (bdifiore@ucsb.edu) and will be uploaded to Dryad in the near future.

# final_analysis.Rmd

This file contains all code associated with grazing data, hurdle models, and data visualizaiton. GrazingMaster.txt and vssecond.csv are the associated data files.

# fishsurvey_final.Rmd

This file contains code associated with cleaning the raw fish survey data files. Specifically it includes calculations of herbivore and predator abundance and density at each patch reef. The output of this code informs the modeling in Final_analysis.Rmd

Thanks for looking!!!
